<h3 class="text-uppercase text-center"> About BJC India Chapter </h3>

<p> The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a curriculum developed at the University of California at Berkeley and
  North Carolina State University to introduce and engage students with computer science. We have had tremendous success
  sharing this course in the United States, having offered professional development to over 500 high school teachers in the
  past decade. Since India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, and a pioneer in bringing innovation in technology,
  we wanted to provide this opportunity to help the Indian education system adapt to this rapidly-growing need. </p>

<p> BJC India is the India Chapter of The Beauty & Joy of Computing curriculum. The India Chapter was conceived by UC Berkeley students (Aayush Shah, Devyanshi Agarwal and Priyans Desai) in the 
beginning of 2019 under the able guidance of Professor Dan Garcia. These students completed their high school from India and have felt that the way CS is being taught in India needs to be strengthend to be able to better prepare students for 
education in the US as well as improve their preparedness for industry experience. To achieve the same, the students realized having taken or worked for CS 10 under Professor Garcia will be the most ideal course to develop a strong foundation.
