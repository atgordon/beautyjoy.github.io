## Overview
The 2019 CS Principles Providers and Teachers Forum is the second gathering of CS Principles educators, providers and teachers in a structured session at SIGCSE.

* Successes and failures of CSP professional development
* Common teaching issues providers and teachers encounter
* Teacher recruitment strategies and keeping in touch with teachers
* Student recruitment strategies
* Preparing for the AP CSP exam
* How to read the results of the AP CSP exam
